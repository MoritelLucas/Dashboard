## **Tech choice**

This API is a NodeJS based application.

Why NodeJS? For this API we used a library that partially wraps GitHub API, this library is in Node JS, so here is why we used node js.

As this API does a lot of database query (I/O) we needed somthing asynchronous and fast, so we used Node JS.

Node JS allows us to use thread and async operation very easily.

## **Description**

The widget API enable developer to interact with the widgets. 

## **Before you dive in**

Here is how works our widgets system.

The widget system relies on *services*, those services are public APIs like (weather API, Nasa API, YouTube API, ...). Those services can be managed throught our dedicated services route.

Each services have one or more available widgets. Those widgets can be used by users.

Each widgets have one or more parameters. For example: the name of the city if we have a temperature widget.

Each user can have one or more widgets.

As we said ... each widgets have parameters. Users can add parameters for their added widgets. They are called widget param.
